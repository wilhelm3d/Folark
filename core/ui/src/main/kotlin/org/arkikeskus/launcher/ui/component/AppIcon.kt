 *
 * No dp height cap on the text: the old `heightIn(max = line × maxLines)` was meant to match the
 * budget, but Android rounds each text line to whole pixels, so two lines came out a pixel taller
 * than the fractional cap and Compose ellipsized the label to ONE line — the drawer's two-line
 * labels never wrapped. The at-most-one-pixel-per-line overshoot is invisible in a centred cell.
 *
 * [reserveLines] makes the label always [maxLines] tall (`minLines`), whether or not the text wraps.
 * The home grid centres icon + label in a fixed cell, so without it a name that wraps lifted its
 * icon half a line above a neighbour whose name did not. Surfaces that top-align their cells (the
 * drawer's grids, the folder sheets) leave it off and let a row grow only when a name wraps.
